            <p> Hi my name is Amir Noshirwani. I am 26 years old and i was born in <strong>Iran</strong>.
                I lived my whole life only in Tehran, the capital of Iran before i get to The Netherlands.
                I studied <strong>Computer science</strong> at High school and after that i got my<strong> Associate Degree</strong>
                in Software engineering at Shahre qods University and studied another 2 years in order to
                get the Bachelor degree but unfortunately it stayed unfinished when i moved to the Netherlands.
            </p>

                <h2 id="work">Work experience</h2>
                <p>Although my education has been always influenced by IT and Computer science but unfortunately
                i have no work experience in that direction. In the other hand i have still experience in Optic 
                direction because it is our family business and i worked there official for more than 5 years.
                Beside i also tried to start my own business and therefore i have had my own <strong>Music band
                </strong> for a while and also a <strong>Catering</strong> for 6 months but both of them were 
                not really my type of work so i did not continue them.
                </p>
